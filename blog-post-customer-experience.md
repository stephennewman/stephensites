# Look at Your Business Through the Eyes of Your Customer

*October 6, 2025 by Stephen Newman*

Let's be real for a second. Most of us running a business here in Palm Harbor, FL get caught up in our own world. We've got our way of doing things, our systems, our opinions on what's right and wrong. And that's fine… until it's not. Because when you stop seeing things through your customer's eyes, that's when your business starts slipping.

If you want your business to stand out—whether you're a roofer, a landscaper, a local restaurant, or a marketing agency—you've got to understand the experience from your customer's perspective. That's where the real growth comes from.

## Innovate on Behalf of the Customer

There's a phrase I've always appreciated: "Innovate on behalf of the customer."

That doesn't mean you have to come up with some fancy new idea every week. For most local service businesses, it's about doing the basics really well. Show up when you say you will. Charge what you promised. Answer your phone. Follow through.

Those simple things still matter more than you might think. They build trust. They build consistency. And once you've got that foundation, you can start going above and beyond. That's what separates good from great.

Because the truth is, customers don't just buy your service. They buy how you make them feel.

## People Change, and So Do Their Expectations

Your customers aren't the same today as they were a year ago. Their needs, their expectations, even how they find you online—it all changes. Maybe last year everyone was on Facebook, and now they're finding you through Google Maps or Instagram.

If you're not paying attention to those shifts, someone else is. Loyalty is earned, but it's fragile. People will switch in a heartbeat if they find a business that feels easier, faster, or more personal to work with.

So your job as a business owner isn't just to sell a product or service. It's to stay tuned in to what your customers actually want—sometimes before they even say it out loud.

## Walk Through Your Own Customer Experience

If you really want to improve, go through your own process like you've never heard of your business before. Google yourself. Check out your own website. Can people easily find your hours, prices, reviews, or how to book an appointment?

Every small detail matters.
- Can a customer see what they paid for last time?
- Do they get reminders or thank-yous?
- Are your promotions or referral offers easy to find?
- Do you respond to reviews, good or bad?

All those small touchpoints add up. They create the full customer experience—what people actually remember about doing business with you.

## Manage Your Reputation Before It Manages You

Let's face it, bad reviews hang around forever. You can't hide from them, but you can own them. Respond honestly, fix what went wrong, and show people you care.

And if you've got happy customers (which you do), make it easy for them to share that experience. Ask for reviews. Ask for referrals. That's the stuff that keeps your reputation strong online and offline.

## Winning in 2025 and Beyond

At the end of the day, success in 2025 is about making it easy to work with you. No friction, no confusion.

Make it simple for people to find you, book you, and trust you. Give them what they need before they have to ask. And if you can do all that with a local, personal touch—one that shows you actually care about your customers—you'll build a business that lasts.

Because while everyone else is focused on ads and algorithms, you'll be focused on people.
